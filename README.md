For loadPiece(app) on line 163, I learned how to use random (and with weights) from this website: https://pynative.com/python-weighted-random-choices-with-probability/

For pieceCollision(app) on line 217 (and the movePiecesLeft, movePiecesRight, movePiecesUp, and movePiecesDown), I looked at the algorithm logic from this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/2048-game-in-python/ but I used most of my logic as well and I did not look at their code (I only looked at the programming logic part)

For noLegalMoves(app) line 305, I got help during office hours for the if/elif logic 

For activateRocket(app, mouseX, mouseY) on line 319, I did not know when to call my powerups so I asked ChatGTP 'in Python, I have powerups and when the player clicks on them they are selected. How should I call my power ups which have a class of their own to make sure it only activates when it's selected? Give me hints, not the code.' I did not use the code from CHatGPT, just the logic hints it gave me

For solveMoveAuto(app, move), I looked at the website: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_shuffle.asp for the shuffling function
